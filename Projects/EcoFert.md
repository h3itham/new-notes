# Business Plan for Establishing an Organic Fertilizer Company in Egypt

## Executive Summary

This business plan outlines the establishment of **EcoFert Egypt**, a company specializing in the production and distribution of organic fertilizers in Egypt. With the growing demand for sustainable agriculture, driven by environmental concerns and government initiatives to expand biogas and organic fertilizer production from agricultural waste, EcoFert Egypt aims to capitalize on the expanding organic farming market, projected to reach USD 798.31 million by 2030 with a CAGR of 7.79%. The company will focus on producing high-quality biofertilizers from local agricultural and livestock waste, targeting farmers shifting to organic practices.
