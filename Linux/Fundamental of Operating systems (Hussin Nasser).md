What is the difference between program and process? 
- *Program*: A _static_ set of instructions stored on disk (e.g., an `.exe` or `.sh` file).
- *Process*: A _running instance_ of a program loaded into memory, with resources (CPU, RAM, etc.).

*Program Counter (PC) / Instruction Pointer (IP)*: is a CPU Register that store the **memory address**  of the next instruction to fetch/execute. 

*Process Control Block (PCB)*: is data structure used by the OS to manage and track process's state and execution context.
