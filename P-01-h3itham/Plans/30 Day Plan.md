 I have one question "Why I always fail in this plan?"  The answer is that you are way from god route. 
 In this plan I'll but bulk of good habits and routine which I'll follow to increase my productivity and make me more powerful and the person who should I be (Great Haitham). 
 - Pray on time. 
 - Stop m** 
 - Start work every day at 6:00 AM. this mean you should walkup at 5:30 AM. 
 - Sleep or go to bed 10:00 AM. 
 - Eat Good Food and focus on salad.  
 - Plan your day. 
 - 100 push up and 100 squad every day. 
 - Stop watch youtube reals. 
 - Take your vitamins.
